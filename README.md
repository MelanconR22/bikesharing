# Bikesharing

# Overview of the analysis: 
Last summer, a friend and I took the trip of a lifetime to New York City and saw all of the sites.  It was a magical experience.  On the flight home, we realized that part of the magical experience came from an unlikely source, citibike.  My friend and I biked everywhere, which really allowed us to get to know the city and interact with people who live there that are using the bikes for their commutes.  

This got us thinking, what if we could start a bike sharing business in our hometown of Des Moines, IA?  A short time upon returning, my friend calls with the news she has found a potential investor who would provide the seed money to explore a bike share program in Des Moines.  The purpose of this analysis is to determine how the bikes are used in New York City to explore ideas of how they could potentially work in Des Moines.
