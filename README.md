# Overview of the analysis: 
Last summer, a friend and I took the trip of a lifetime to New York City and saw all of the sites.  It was a magical experience.  On the flight home, we realized that part of the magical experience came from an unlikely source, citibike.  My friend and I biked everywhere, which really allowed us to get to know the city and interact with people who live there that are using the bikes for their commutes.  

This got us thinking, what if we could start a bike sharing business in our hometown of Des Moines, IA?  A short time upon returning, my friend calls with the news she has found a potential investor who would provide the seed money to explore a bike share program in Des Moines.  The purpose of this analysis is to determine how the bikes are used in New York City to explore ideas of how they could potentially work in Des Moines.

The following analaysis seeks to understand how bikes are used in New York City to see if there is a possible link that would help such a business be successful in Des Moines, IA.  Let's take a look at the ride sharing data and see what we can uncover.

Citibike is popular in New York City and many people use it to explore New York City.  The business is set up with subscribers who pay a fee of $15/month to use the bike up to 45-minutes per ride for an unlimited number of times each month.  There is also a single 30-minute trip fee of $3.99 per trip or an unlimited amount of 30-minute rides with a day pass that costs $15/day.  

The data analyzed was collected for the month of August in 2019.  During that month, the following data shows the total number of rides taken in NYC.

The total number of trips taken in the month of August was 2,344,224!  That averages out to 75,620 trips per day based on a 31 day month.  This is an incredibly popular service and New Yorkers and tourists are taking advantage.  

Let's see what else we can uncover from the data.

This chart shows the number of trips by trip duration length.  Most trips last between 0 and 30 minutes with 5 minute duration being the most popular with a count of 146,752 trips.

![Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107599510/194690406-5ba2ca15-96b4-4fb2-b4a9-5103acd595b3.png)

The next thing to look at is the gender breakout of users.  There are three categories for gender of users.  They are male, female, and unknown.  During the checkout process, some users must skip entering data about their gender.  The total in the unknown category is 225,521 or 9.62%.  Females make up the second largest user of the bikes at 588,431 or 25.10%.  Males make up the largest segment of users with a total of 1,530,272 or 65.28% of total users.

The chart above shows trip duration times broken out by gender.  Similar to previous charts, 0 - 30 minutes are a popular time to rent a bike.  Males had a mode of 5 minute trip durations and females had a mode of 6 minute trip durations.

This heat map is showing the usage of bikes by hour, day, and gender.  The overall pattern makes sense with more usage around 8 am as well as 5-7 pm during the week.  On weekends, the usage is a little more spread out through the day with more rides occurring between 10am and 5 pm.
